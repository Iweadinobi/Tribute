<h2>Here's a timeline of Dr. Borlaug's life:</h2><br>
<ul>
    <li>1914 - Born in Cresco, Iowa</li><br>
    <li>1933 - Leaves his family's farm to attend the University of Minnesota, thanks <br> to a Depression era program known as the "National Youth Administration"</li><br>
    <li>1935 - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the Civilian <br> Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw how food changed <br> them", he said. "All of this left scars on me."</li><br>
    <li>1937 - Finishes university and takes a job in the US Forestry Service</li><br>
    <li>1938 - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets laid off due to budget <br> cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to school study under <br> Stakman, who teaches him about breeding pest-resistent plants.</li><br>
    <li>1941 - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is <br> rejected. Instead, the military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT <br> to control malaria, disinfectants, and other applied science.</li><br>
    <li>1942 - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology</li><br>
    <li>1944 - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his <br> pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology program. <br> Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different strains of disease <br> resistent wheat - including different varieties for each major climate on Earth</li><br>
    <li>1945 - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat yields</li><br>
    <li>1953 - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling <br> American breed, creating a strain that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to <br> provide 95% of Mexico's <br> wheat.</li><br>
    <li>1962 - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the Indian <br> subcontinent in time to help mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly <br> expanding population</li><br>
    <li>1970 - receives the Nobel Peace Prize</li><br>
    <li>1983 - helps seven African countries dramatically increase their maize and <br> sorghum yields</li><br>
    <li>1984 - becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M University</li><br>
    <li>2005 - states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050." Argues <br> that genetically modified crops are the only way we can meet the demand, as <br> we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not inherently dangerous <br> because "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long <br> time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds."</li><br>
    <li>2009 - dies at the age of 95.</li><br>
</ul>
